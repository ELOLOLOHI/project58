      <p> ALthough Demi Lovato isn't my favorite singer, she is still a really good one. She was born on August 20, 1992 in Albuquerque, New Mexico & raised in Dallas, Texas. Demi started out as a child actor on Barney & Friends. In 2007, Demi Lovato got a part on a short Disney Channel show called As the Bell Rings, and then she landed the starring role of the movie Camp Rock. While filming Camp Rock, Demi Lovato began also recording three songs for the film's soundtrack and has had several solo releases since. In 2009, Lovato got the lead in the series Sonny with a Chance, another Disney Channel show. She later became a judge on the television competition show The X Factor from 2012 to 2013.</p>
